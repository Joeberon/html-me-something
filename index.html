    <h2>Empire State Building</h2>
    <p>
    Our fist big immersion into the city was making it to the top of the Empire State Building where we were able to look across the city. We took in the sights and bright lights that enveloped us.

    <h3>Time Square</h3>
    <p>The heart of this beautiful city is Time Square. Hotdogs, street performers and color lights and advertisements encircled us. We still found time to take a group picture.
